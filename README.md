# OnChain Land Administration
The aim of this project is to implement the [ISO 19152:2012 standard (Geographic information â€” Land Administration Domain Model (LADM))](https://www.iso.org/standard/51206.html) on the Ethereum Blockchain.

The starting point for that will be the [Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA-FAO)](https://github.com/SOLA-FAO/) which is a J2EE implementation that has many uses cases in Africa and Asia, see [UN FAO - Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA) & Open Tenure Using open-source software to help protect tenure rights](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5480e.pdf).

Using SOLA allows to incorporates international best practice and standards, facilitating the essential customization always required to meet specific country needs, as Cadastre and registration functions and services provided by a typical land office.

This project is challenging because it implements geospatial data management features, needed to handle land parcels, on the Blockchain technology, which is an open research subject at the [Open Geospatial Consortium](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/dp/18-041r1/18-041r1.html) where a [Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies Domain Working Group](https://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/bdltdwg) has been created

# Implementation details

The FOAM protocole, developped by [FOAM space](https://foam.space/) was implemented using the [White Paper](https://foam.space/publicAssets/FOAM_Whitepaper.pdf) with a set of solidity smart contracts and a client/server applications for the spatial index management and visualisation. Some modifications was implemented to explore the alternatives suggested by the [OGC discussion paper ($7.5)](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/dp/18-041r1/18-041r1.html)

For the Crypto-Spatial Coordinates, the javascript interface of the [H3 library](https://uber.github.io/h3/) was used with the [resolution 15](https://uber.github.io/h3/#/documentation/core-library/resolution-table). This library implements the [Geodesic Discrete Global Grid Systems](http://webpages.sou.edu/~sahrk/sqspc/pubs/gdggs03.pdf) OGC standard.

For the spatial index backend the [OGC API - Features - Part 1 : Core](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.pdf) and the [ArcGIS REST API Feature Service](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/feature-feature-service-.htm) was used as a standarized REST API dedicated to manage geospatial data objects. The geospatial data are stored in a [Spatialite database](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite).

For the Frontend the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library is used to display a map with a markers representing the added indexes.

**Comparison with the FOAM protocole implementation**
- Spatialite -> PostgreSQL/PostGIS, redis
- Leaflet -> deck.gl
- H3 (DGGS) -> geohash
- Truffle -> Chanterelle
- JavaScript -> Purescript, Haskell

Project Setup
============

Clone this GitHub repository. 
``` 
git clone https://github.com/allilou/onchain-land-administration.git
```
Since the project is developped using the [truffle framework](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), you should check the network configuration in `solidity/truffle-config.js` before continuing.

Compile and migrate the solidity contracts to your local EVM.
```
cd solidity 
truffle migrate --reset
```

Install dependiencies and compile Node.js/Express backend server.
```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Install dependiencies and compile React/Web3 frontend web application.

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
## Usage 
The following sequence diagram illustrate the interaction between the diffrent components.

![](./docs/diagrams/exports/sequence-foam/sequence-foam.png)

You can trigger a transaction simply by clicking on the map or by firing the 'Add CSC Index' button. A marker with the 'Transaction Hash' will be added at the clicked position on the map.
